          Backpacking in Cambodia
          <hr />

        <article>
          <p>
            Backpacking Cambodia was one of the best experiences I ever had.
            When I first visited Cambodia, I had low expectations for the
            country. I hadn’t heard much about it. I only knew it’s horrible
            past and that it wasn’t that developed. I didn’t expect much. But,
            traveling Cambodia, I was blown away by how friendly the people
            were, how beautiful the country was, and how much there was to see
            and do there. Now, Cambodia one of my all-time favorite travel
            destinations – and I think it’s one of the most underrated countries
            in the world. I can’t speak highly enough about it!
          </p>
          <p>
            Since that first visit all the way back in 2006, I’ve been back
            dozens of times (even spending over a month there writing a book)
            and the country still remains a favorite! Cambodia is still trying
            to find its way after the horrifying genocide that was carried out
            by the Khmer Rouge regime (led by Pol Pot) between 1975 and 1979
            when about 1.5-3 million Cambodian people were killed. It left a
            deep, deep wound on the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, here you’ll find a place filled with some of the
            friendliest people I’ve ever encountered, rich history, delicious
            food, beautiful coastlines, and a lively nightlife. Spend some extra
            time traveling through Cambodia exploring the temples (there’s more
            than just Angkor Wat), taking in the deserted, white sand beaches,
            the growing foodie and gastronomy scene, its complext history, lush
            jungles, and wonderful culture. (It’s also a really cheap country to
            visit!)
          </p>

              These temple ruins are massive, and you’ll need a few days to
              satisfying your inner Tomb Raider and exploring these ruins. If
              you’re not a history buff then just purchase a single-day ticket
              ($37). Everyone else may want to consider the 3-day ticket ($72),
              which offers a bit of a discount.

              Here you’ll find great temples, a bamboo train, and stunning
              architecture. It’s Cambodia without the tourism — for now! Try
              taking a river boat back to Phnom Phen or Siem Reap for a unique
              experience (tickets are usually around $20 USD per person).

              As the capital of Cambodia, this place has a wild west ambiance

              the city.

        <span class="title">Cambodia Travel Costs</span>
        <label>Accommodation</label>
        <p>
          Dorm rooms in hostels start at around $4 USD per night. Private rooms
          in hostels and guesthouses generally go for $5-10 USD per night,
          depending on where you are in the country. Free WiFi is the norm for
          hostels these days, and a few will also include free breakfast. You
          can get comfortable guesthouse rooms for $15-20 USD with air con, TV,
          and other amenities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond that, the sky is the limit but I’ve never needed to spend more
          than $25 USD per night for luxury in this country! Airbnb is available
          in the major cities, with prices starting around $10 USD per night for
          shared accommodation. For an entire home or apartment, expect to pay
          closer to $30 USD per night.
        </p>
        <label>Food</label>
        <p>
          Food is very cheap in Cambodia. Local street vendors will cost you
          about $1-2 USD per meal, and basic restaurant meals will cost between
          $3-5 USD. Western meals at nice restaurants go between $5-15 USD per
          person. If you want to splurge, you can get some really world-class
          food in Phnom Phen these days for around $8-10 USD. If you plan on
          buying your own groceries and cooking your own meals expect to pay
          between $20-25 USD per week, depending on your diet. Stick to local
          markets for the cheapest produce.
        </p>
        <label>Transportation</label>
        <p>
          Local city transportation is cheap, costing only a few dollars.
          Tuk-tuks can be found on every corner in the big cities, though be
          sure to negotiate a price in advance (usually not more than $5 USD
          depending on the distance). Renting a driver for the day will set you
          back between $15-20 USD, and most hostels can help you arrange finding
          one.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Generally speaking</em>, you can get a bus anywhere in the country
          for under $20 USD. For example, buses depart regularly from Siem Reap
          into Thailand for as little as $15 USD each way. Both buses and
          mini-buses also make the journey from Siem Reap to Phnom Penh daily
          for $10 USD per person.
        </p>
        <label>Activities</label>
        <p>
          Those planning on visiting Angkor Wat (and you should be!) should
          factor in the cost of the entrance fee, which is around $40 USD per
          day. Also, be sure to factor in the cost to travel there. Other tours,
          hikes, and entrance fees are between $10-20 USD depending on the
          length and popularity of the activity.
